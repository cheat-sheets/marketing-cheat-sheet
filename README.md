## Branding

### Marketing 101: Building Strong Brands

**Market** is an exchange between two parties, usually a buyer and a seller.

**Seller's Market** - an economic situation in which goods or shares are scarce and sellers can keep prices high. 
Usually **Product Focused Marketing** is used in such markets.  

**Buyer's Market** - an economic situation in which goods or shares are plentiful and buyers can keep prices down.
Usually **Customer Focused Marketing** is used in such markets.

In product focused marketing you try do develop the best product/service and sell it to as many customers as possible.
Market share is the fraction of the market buying your product.

In customer focused marketing you pick customers and create products/services customized to their needs.
Customer share is the fraction of the maximum amount of product/services a customer can possibly buy from you.  

**Production Orientation** - persuade customer to want what the firm has.

**Marketing Orientation** - persuade firm to offer what the customer wants.
 
**Experience Orientation** - manage customer's entire experience with the firm.

**Trust Orientation** - prioritize building a relationship of trust and discipline. 

**3 Principles of Marketing**

1. **Principle of Customer Value** - you have to provide real value to customers.
2. **Principle of Differentiation** - you have to differentiate your offering from the competition.
3. **Principle of Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning** - you choose a segment of the market and position your brand 
to meet the needs of that target segment.

**4 P's of Marketing**

1. **Product** - what you offer.
2. **Place** - how the product will be provided to the customer. 
3. **Promotion** - advertising, sales promotions, special offers and public relations.
4. **Price** - the actual amount the end user is expected to pay for a product.  

### Strategic Marketing

**Market-Driven Principles**

1. Know your Markets
2. Customers choose the product that delivers the best on one of the dimensions they care most about:
  - **Product features/design** (style, innovation, technology)  
  - **Operational** (delivery, service, reliability) 
  - **Whether it meets their needs**
3. Commit to being first in the markets you serve.
4. Deliver total quality to guarantee customer satisfaction.

**Strategies for Leadership**

1. **Performance superiority** - focus on product features/design
2. **Operation excellence** - focus on operational aspects
3. **Customer Intimacy** - focus on meeting customers' needs

### Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning (STP)

1. **Segmentation** - identify variables that allow one to segment the market.
2. **Targeting** - evaluate the attractiveness of each segment and choose a target segment.
3. **Positioning** - identify positioning concepts for each target segment, select the best, and communicate it.

**Segmentation Methods** 

1. Characteristics of the customers - gender, race, age, geographical location.
  - Cohort analysis: Babyboomers, Generation X (1966-1976), Generation Y (1977-1997).
2. Benefits sought - e.g. for running shoes: comfort, aesthetics, technology.
3. Systematic, product-related behaviours - purchasing behaviour (buys weekly or monthly), by channel (online or in stores).
 
Formally a **brand** is a proprietary trademark for a specific product or service. 
Conceptually, a brand is a "contract"
from the company to its customers; a promise of specific benefits, quality, and value. A relationship.
Essentially, a brand is what consumers tell each other it is.

A **positioning statement** includes:

1. **Target Segment** (for whom)
2. **Point of Difference** (how it's different from competition)
3. **Frame of Reference** (the scope of products/services), also called Point of Parity

### Brand Mantra: The Elevator Speech

**Brand Mantra** is an articulation of the "heart and soul" of the brand. 
It's the "brand essence", a "core brand promise".

**Brand Mantra** is a short three- to five-word phrase that captures the irrefutable essence or spirit of the brand
positioning and brand values.

Considerations:
- Communicate
- Simplify
- Inspire

Parts of the brand mantra:
1. The **brand function** describes the nature of the product or service or the type of experiences or benefits the 
brand provides.
2. The **descriptive modifier** further clarifies its nature.
3. The **emotional modifier** provides another qualifier, that evokes emotions.

### Experiential Branding

Customer experiences are very  important for developing a brand because they trigger stimulations to the senses,
heart and mind. 

Redefining what a brand is from the experiential position:

- Differentiation -> Experience
- Promise -> Relationship
- Attributes -> Personality
- Static -> Dynamic
- Mass -> Individual
- Awareness -> Relevance
